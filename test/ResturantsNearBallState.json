It was dry and flavorless. Its almost like the cooked them in the morning and kept them drying out under a heat lamp all day then dumped a bunch of water like liquid all over it and because the wings were so rubbery and dry it just fell off of it and wouldnt stick to the wings. We got the ginger teriyaki and BBQ. BBQ was also not good. Also they had holes in the container they put them in and the liquid got all over our clothes...lovely. We did take them home to feed to dogs because they wouldnt take them off the bill so figured at least if we have to pay for it someone should eat it. Literally might as well have thrown my $30 in the trash lol. They also had no soda that had carbonation working but didnt warn me of this as I ordered a soda and had that awful flat old soda taste. They were kind to take that off the bill at least.\n\nIll say we did enjoy the appetizers. They were top notch.\n\nDONT get the wings. I repete DONT get the wings. HORRENDOUS condition and youll have to pay for them. So sad. Left hungry.\n\nIf you want to try this place its worth the drive out to Carmel. We were treated much better there and the food was outstanding. We will be going back to that location in Carmel.",

Prices were rocket high compared to other local Muncie places for food and drink. Okay, no problem. We decided to grab takeout from Yats on our way out of town on Sunday in the later afternoon. At the last second, we thought, \"Hey, let's grab another drink for each us from The Cup before we leave town!\"\n\nSo, we walked across the street. One of us grabbed a patio table and the other went to place our order. I ordered, and paid for, a dirty iced chai (a dirty hippie) and a frozen/blended chai. In the time I was there, I watched an employee argue with a mother who was asking for a larger cup of water for her and her very small child to share after she placed a $20+ order (they originally told her that the only free water cups were the 2 oz. ones). They finally gave it to her. When my order was ready, they made my frozen chai dirty. I said, \"Oh, I'm sorry, this is not what I ordered. I actually ordered and paid for a regular frozen chai.\" I even had a receipt to prove it. The barista simply said, \"That's not what I've got on my end. So this is what I made.\" I said, \"Sorry, no problem. I'll just take it as is.\" He proceeded to say, \"If you really want me to, I'll remake it.\" It was clearly not something he wanted to do. No worries.\n\nI stopped in the bathroom and it was trashed. Broken/cracked toilet, hadn't been cleaned in who knows how long, and overall just gross.\n\nI walked outside with my two drinks and sat down with my partner, who still had our to-go Yats in hand. At this point, between drinks and tips, we have spent $40+ at The Cup between Saturday and Sunday. We opened our Yats to take a bite and were IMMEDIATELY informed by an employee that we can't have ANYTHING that wasn't purchased at The Cup. We were asked to leave. I didn't even fight it. I said \"Okay, no problem.\" We proceeded to walk BACK across the street to Yats, where, shockingly, not a single employee bothered us for using their patio while holding drinks from a nearby local restaurant as we ate the food we purchased from them. Shocking. It's almost like that's just how local business works...\n\nTL;DR: It's overpriced, dirty, and employees are rude. Can't imagine management is any better.",

But, he handled like a pro and his attitude was second to none as he served quickly, safely, and with a smile.

And worth the $4.99/cup. We split a carrot cake waffles which was also very good!\n\nI had the fillet eggs Benedict which was good! The meat wasn't a fillet though, much too tough to be a fillet and they never asked how I would like it cooked.\n\nOne friend has the brisket eggs Benedict and she said it was good as well.\n\nThe other friend had an omelet and fruit with sourdough which she said was good too!\n\nOur server was nice, attentive and let us have our space to talk and enjoy each other's company.\n\nWhen we left it was super busy and they had several people waiting for tables so I recommend getting there before 11:20 if you don't want to have a long wait.\n\nThey're also opening a location in Richmond,IN.

Got white rice instead fried but it happens! Still great.  I’m so full I cannot try the hot and sour soup but I’m sure it will be lovely.

            "text": "Great experience at 1925 Pub House today! It was our first time trying this place. Emma our waitress was awasome. We showed up downtown Muncie as a graduation was leaving the field house. So, not so great on timing to eat here for our anniversary celebration on our part.  You wouldn't had known it though-service was fast and for the busy nature that larger groups create we anticipated some wait time.\n\nFood was great. As normal for us we had to alter our requests just a bit for our tastes. So that is allowed here.\n\nFor our appetizer we had the Pub Pretzel Sticks and Beer Cheese. WE ASKED FOR NO SALT. This was very good. The pretzel and the cheese by themselves are wonderful but together a perfect blend of flavor. We even asked if they would sell us the cheese. A fact Emma was not sure but was happy to find out. 5oz and 32oz were or options.  Not sure what we will do with our 32oz of cheese but it will be yummy.\n\nMy Wife had the Fried Chicken Sandwich with a Wedge salad side. Both were delicious for her. After consuming both she was rather full.\n\nI had the Texas Smash burger WITH NO CARMELIZED ONIONS and fries as my side. I avoided the East Coast Fries seasoning but got some queso on the side to try. Loved my burger smashed burger gave it the Stake N Shake look and texture. The Angus beef was good but for me it doesn't do anything special for me except be less greesy. The bacon had great flavor but was a bit hard to chew as it was rubbery. As if it had been in a warmer too long. Cooks could've been a bit better on attention to detail there. I don't like onions thats why I didn't get them. The fries were good crinkle fries and had just a bit of salt. Good for me not a huge salt person.  But you have to try the queso cheese. it is yummy with just a bit of kick you don't get til the end. Very good.\n\nPrices for the dishes are rather high in price but the quality and the more premium ingredients make up for the extra expense.  Your food will have that quality taste to it and you will love to taste the flavors in your mouth.\n\nGreat service, Emma was fun, willing to let us be picky, let us ask odd questions like buying the beer cheese that was not an option on the menu. Highly recommend her to be your server. Great food as stated a few times above. Atmosphere was very nice more classy than a BW3, or Applebee's. Food was much better quality as well and more choices you wouldn't see every day. Emma told us to try the Turkey Chipotle Melt but the other things sounded good then. Maybe next time... We will be back. Maybe with our 3 year old next time.",

            "text": "Great experience at 1925 Pub House today! It was our first time trying this place. Emma our waitress was awasome. We showed up downtown Muncie as a graduation was leaving the field house. So, not so great on timing to eat here for our anniversary celebration on our part.  You wouldn't had known it though-service was fast and for the busy nature that larger groups create we anticipated some wait time.\n\nFood was great. As normal for us we had to alter our requests just a bit for our tastes. So that is allowed here.\n\nFor our appetizer we had the Pub Pretzel Sticks and Beer Cheese. WE ASKED FOR NO SALT. This was very good. The pretzel and the cheese by themselves are wonderful but together a perfect blend of flavor. We even asked if they would sell us the cheese. A fact Emma was not sure but was happy to find out. 5oz and 32oz were or options.  Not sure what we will do with our 32oz of cheese but it will be yummy.\n\nMy Wife had the Fried Chicken Sandwich with a Wedge salad side. Both were delicious for her. After consuming both she was rather full.\n\nI had the Texas Smash burger WITH NO CARMELIZED ONIONS and fries as my side. I avoided the East Coast Fries seasoning but got some queso on the side to try. Loved my burger smashed burger gave it the Stake N Shake look and texture. The Angus beef was good but for me it doesn't do anything special for me except be less greesy. The bacon had great flavor but was a bit hard to chew as it was rubbery.

Steak was good, and the bacon app and creme'brulee were both amazing.  Great margaritas and cold beer.  Smoked ol fashion is a great choice, too.",

I'm in a wheelchair and we were seated at the back at a table. The atmosphere I gave 3 stars only because of the noise level & acoustics and tables are tight. It was decorated beautifully. It was very difficult to maneuver my chair down the main aisle too. It was very tight with booths down one side and people in chairs at tables down the other side. I had to ask some people to scoot up which they were very polite about and I thanked them. We were greeted by our server Huda who had such a beautiful smile and the most sincere personable & outgoing personality! No matter how yucky of a day you had, you couldn't help but smile back at her! I'm 52 yrs old and Huda was thee best, most attentive server I've ever had yet! We told her too and she genuinely appreciated it too. We got cornbread and bread brought out and omg..best cornbread! We had a shrimp cocktail and crabcakes for appetizers. Exceptional!!! Then hubby got prime rib, baked potato and mushrooms. I got the filet mignon, asparagus and baked potato. Dessert we shared a creme Brulee and Huda brought us out a choc cupcake with a candle for our anniversary which was a sweet unexpected gesture. As we were eating a well dressed gentleman came over to us and said thank you coming in this evening. Then he returned to a booth he was setting at dining too. Turns out it was Mr. Ron Lahody himself, the owner who was there dining. The staff said they hadn't seen him in awhile as he'd had surgery. I wish I had known who he was as I would've expressed to him how impressed we were with the food & Huda! So my apologies Ron. Let me tell you that was hands down the best steak I have ever had in my life! My first time having creme brulee too and it was also divine! I hope someone there sees this review and gives Huda a pat on the back. She was truly a great first impression with her smile. We will def be back! Mr. Lahody I'm sorry I hadn't tried it sooner. I've been to the meat market but not the steakhouse. You got a good thing going there!",
